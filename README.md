## Controllers

The TunifyPlatform uses controllers to manage incoming HTTP requests and responses. Each controller corresponds to a specific entity in the application:

- **UsersController**: Manages user-related actions, including fetching, creating, updating, and deleting users.
- **ArtistsController**: Handles requests related to artists, such as retrieving artist details and managing artist data.
- **PlaylistsController**: Deals with operations on playlists, including their creation, modification, and retrieval.
- **SongsController**: Oversees song-related functionalities, including fetching song details and updating song information.


## Repositories

Repositories abstract data access and provide a clean API for data operations. The following repositories are defined:

- **IUser**: Interface for user data operations.
- **IArtists**: Interface for artist-related data operations.
- **IPlayList**: Interface for playlist data operations.
- **ISong**: Interface for song data operations.


## Services

Services contain the business logic of the application and interact with the repositories to perform data operations:

- **UserServices**: Implements `IUser` and provides methods to manage user data.
- **ArtistsServices**: Implements `IArtists` to handle artist data management.
- **PlaylistsServices**: Implements `IPlayList` for playlist-related business logic.
- **SongServices**: Implements `ISong` to handle song data and logic.

## Swagger UI Integration

Swagger UI is included in the TunifyPlatform project to offer easy-to-use, interactive documentation for the API. It helps you explore and test the available endpoints.

### How to Access Swagger UI

1. **Start the Application**: Run the app using your preferred method (e.g., `dotnet run`, Visual Studio).

2. **Open Swagger UI**: Once running, open a web browser and go to:  
   `http://localhost:{PORT}/TunifySwagger`
